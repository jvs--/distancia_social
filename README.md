Influence of social distancing/isolation on disease spread simulation.

This script demonstrates the influence social distancing can have on the spread
of a disease such as Covid-19 in a population by a simplified simulation.

!! This is not by any means a simulation based on realistic 
numbers right now. It's in the process of being made more realistic !!
